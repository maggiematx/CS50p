Developed a Python program, `outdated.py`, that prompts the user for a date in either MM/DD/YYYY format or Month Day, Year format (e.g., 9/8/1636 or September 8, 1636). The program converts and outputs the date in YYYY-MM-DD format. It handles month names from the list of full month names and treats the input case-insensitively. If the user inputs an invalid date in either format, the program prompts them to enter the date again. The program assumes that every month has no more than 31 days, without validating the specific number of days in each month.
