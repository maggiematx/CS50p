Developed a Python program, `extensions.py`, which prompts the user for a file name and outputs the fileâ€™s media type based on its suffix. If the file name ends with `.gif`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.pdf`, `.txt`, or `.zip` (case-insensitively), the corresponding media type is output. If the file name ends with a different suffix or has no suffix, the program outputs `application/octet-stream` as the default.
