Developed a Python program, `emojize.py`, that prompts the user for a string in English and outputs the "emojized" version of that string. The program converts any recognized emoji codes or aliases within the string to their corresponding emojis. This allows the user to input text containing emoji codes (e.g., :smile:) and see the text output with the actual emojis replacing the codes.
