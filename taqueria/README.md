Developed a Python program, `taqueria.py`, that allows a user to place an order by prompting them for items one at a time until they input control-d to end the input. After each item is entered, the program displays the total cost of all items entered so far, formatted as a dollar amount with two decimal places. The program treats user input case-insensitively and ignores any input that doesnâ€™t match an item on the menu. It assumes that all menu items are titlecased.
