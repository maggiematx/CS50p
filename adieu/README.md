Developed a Python program, `adieu.py`, that prompts the user to input names one at a time until the user inputs control-d. The program assumes that at least one name will be entered. After gathering all the names, the program bids adieu to the names in a grammatically correct format:

- For two names, the names are separated by " and".
- For three names, the first two names are separated by a comma, and the last two names are separated by " and".
- For more than three names, all names except the last are separated by commas, with " and" before the final name.
