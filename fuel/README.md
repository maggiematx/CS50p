Developed a Python program, `fuel.py`, that prompts the user for a fraction formatted as X/Y, where both X and Y are integers. The program then outputs the amount of fuel in the tank as a percentage, rounded to the nearest integer. If 1% or less remains, it outputs "E" to indicate the tank is nearly empty. If 99% or more remains, it outputs "F" to indicate the tank is nearly full.

The program ensures that X and Y are valid integers, that X is not greater than Y, and that Y is not zero. If any of these conditions are not met, or if exceptions like ValueError or ZeroDivisionError occur, the program prompts the user to input the fraction again.
