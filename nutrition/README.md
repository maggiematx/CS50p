Developed a Python program, `nutrition.py`, that prompts users to input the name of a fruit (case-insensitively) and outputs the number of calories in one portion of that fruit, based on the FDA's poster. The program assumes users will input fruit names exactly as listed on the poster (e.g., "strawberries," not "strawberry"). Any input that isnâ€™t a recognized fruit name is ignored.
