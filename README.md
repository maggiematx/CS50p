This is my solutions for the CS50p problem sets. This course is structured over 10 weeks and progressively introduces fundamental programming concepts. Starting with basic functions and variables, it builds on conditionals, loops, and exceptions. As the course progresses, it covers libraries, unit tests, and file I/O, before moving on to more advanced topics like regular expressions and object-oriented programming. Each week includes a lecture on a specific topic followed by a corresponding problem set, with the final week dedicated to reviewing and submitting a final project that encompasses the skills learned throughout the course.
