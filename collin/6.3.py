"""
The output of the code is:
I did it again!
I see!
THE END.

The inner try block attempts to divide n (which is 0) by 0, resulting in a ZeroDivisionError.
The inner except block catches the ZeroDivisionError, prints "I did it again!", and then re-raises the exception.
The outer except ArithmeticError block catches the ZeroDivisionError when it's called with arguement 0.
It prints "I see!" to indicate it caught an arithmetic error.
Finally, "THE END." is printed because itâ€™s outside of the outer try-except structure and executes regardless of whether an exception was caught or not.
