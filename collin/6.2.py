# Define function bad_fun(n) that raises a ZeroDivisionError
def bad_fun(n):
    raise ZeroDivisionError

try:
    # Call bad_fun with 0, which raises ZeroDivisionError
    bad_fun(0)

# Catch ArithmeticError which is a general class of ZeroDivisionError
except ArithmeticError:
    # Print a statement indicating an error has occured
    print("What happened? An error?")

# The print statement executes regardless of whether an exception was caught or not
print("THE END.")

"""
The output of the code is:
What happened? An error?
THE END.

bad_fun(0) is called in the try block, which raises a ZeroDivisionError because dividing by zero (0) is not allowed.
The except ArithmeticError block catches the ZeroDivisionError.
It then prints "What happened? An error?".
Finally, "THE END." is printed because itâ€™s outside of the try-except block and executes regardless of whether an exception was caught or not.
