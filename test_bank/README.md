Developed a Python program, `bank.py`, which prompts the user for a greeting. If the greeting starts with "hello" (case-insensitively and ignoring leading whitespace), the program outputs $0. If the greeting starts with an "h" but not "hello," it outputs $20. For any other greeting, it outputs $100.

In a file called `test_bank.py`, implemented three or more functions to thoroughly test the value function from bank.py. Each test function is named beginning with test_, allowing you to execute your tests with: pytest test_bank.py
