Developed a Python program, `grocery.py`, that prompts the user to input grocery items one per line until they input control-d to end the input. Afterward, the program outputs the grocery list in all uppercase, with the items sorted alphabetically. Each line is prefixed with the number of times the user inputted that item. The program handles user input case-insensitively and does not pluralize the items.
